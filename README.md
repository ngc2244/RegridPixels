# Where to make change in RegridPixels.f90
You may need to change the format of input files (around line 160 )
However, try to make change in run.sh, instead of RegridPixels.f90. By doing this you won't mess up the code.

# Compile:
gfortran -o RegridPixels.x cakecut_m.f90 tools_m.f90 RegridPixels.f90

# Run:
./run.sh
